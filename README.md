### About

I lead the shopping product tracking team at Microsoft AI. I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science from Purdue University. Before joining Microsoft, I was a staff R&D engineer at IBM, working in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, and machine translation. My current focus is to leverage artificial intelligence to create intelligent and adaptive solutions that deliver value to users.

### About

I'm a technical engineering and science leader with extensive experience driving end-to-end data-centric projects. Currently, I lead agentic shopping at Microsoft AI. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue University, where I specialized in Knowledge Graph Data Management. Prior to Microsoft, I served as a Research Engineer at IBM, focusing on machine learning, natural language processing, and machine translation.

My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical applications, with a particular emphasis on leveraging AI to enhance data understanding and integration. I'm passionate about developing scalable solutions that transform how we interact with and derive insights from complex data systems.

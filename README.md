### About

I'm a Data & Applied Science Manager at Microsoft, where I lead a team of data scientists and engineers who are responsible for building and enhancing the content understanding capabilities for Microsoft Edge Shopping and Microsoft Autos Marketplace. At Microsoft, I lead several data-centric products, including Microsoft Edge Shopping Product Tracking, Microsoft Autos My Garage, and Microsoft Autos AI Assistant. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue University. Before joining Microsoft, I was a Staff R&D Engineer at IBM, working in the areas of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Translation. My areas of interest include artificial intelligence, knowledge graphs, data management, data integration, and data cleaning. My mission is to leverage data science and artificial intelligence to create intelligent and adaptive solutions that deliver value to users.
